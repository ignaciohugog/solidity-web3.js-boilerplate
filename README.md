# Solidity with Web3.js boilerplate
A boilerplate for Smart Contract Development, Compiling, Deployment and Testing

This boilerplate was created for Udemy course by Stephen Grider - "Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide". I was using it for  during the course, later for easy Proof of Concept contract development, so I decided to publish to github. 

It makes easy to compile and test smart contract ideas.

It is using ganache-cli to deploy contract for testing

It is using web3.js to interface with contract

It is using mocha to test contract
